<main>
    <p>I love using <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language, the markup language used to author websites">HTML</abbr>
        playgrounds for quick experiments and to quickly explain things to someone via social media. And I think their
        coolest feature is that they have shareable <abbr
                title="Uniform Resource Locator,  the address of a website or another ressource on the internet">URLs</abbr>.
    </p>
    <p>And recently I experimented a lot with little tools that are static websites. They are handy because they are
        super easy to deploy, and easy to maintain. And there are plenty of options to host static websites, so you can
        provide them at nearly no cost or even for free.</p>
    <h2 id="the-problem">The problem: Storage</h2>
    <p>However, static websites come with one big disadvantage. They don't have any possibility to store data.</p>
    <p>Static website hosting usually doesn't provide a way to run server-side software or to use a database, so you
        can't store user-created content, which is the key requirement to have sharable URls for an HTML playground.</p>
    <p>Or is it?</p>
    <h2 id="the-idea">The idea: Brotli</h2>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli">Brotli</a> is a lossless data compression algorithm that is great
        for compressing HTML, JS, and CSS. So it's basically perfect to compress the contents of an HTML playground.</p>
    <p>So what happens if we compress the playground's data good enough that we can put all of a playground's contents
        in the URL itself? Then we wouldn't need any storage because the URL itself already contains all information to
        display the playground.</p>
    <p>And that's how <a href="https://playground.lukas.stuehrk.net">my playground was born</a>. Here's how it works:
    </p>
    <p>The playground works like a regular HTML playground where you can edit HTML, CSS, and JS. Whenever you change its
        contents, a live preview is rendered as well. And whenever you edit the playground, its contents are compressed
        via Brotli and put in the URL.</p>
    <p>For example, here's how the playground with a hello world example looks like: <code><a
            href="https://playground.lukas.stuehrk.net/#GzAAgBSh0hHmlvozhcqYrVicleiEDThwyMJIB8Aj1A6M6KXHvEqfXHOreML6wp5RhIsf">https://playground.&shy;lukas.&shy;stuehrk.net/&shy;#GzAAgBSh0hHmlvozhcqYrVicleiEDThwyMJIB8Aj1A6M6KXHvEqfXHOreML6wp5RhIsf</a></code>
    </p>
    <p>So when you then copy its URL and send it to someone else, they can restore the very same contents from the
        information that is put in the URL.</p>
    <p>Now, there are multiple ways how you could store the contents in the URL: In the path, a query parameter, or the
        fragment. I chose the fragment because this provides one interesting side effect: The actual contents of the
        playground are never sent to the server that hosts the website! They never leave your browser!</p>
    <h2 id="disadvantages">Disadvantages</h2>
    <p>However, this comes with one big disadvantage: you cannot change the playground's contents once that you've shared its URLs
        with someone else. So if you accidentally included some sensitive data in the playground, there's no way to
        remove it anymore.</p>
