    <h1>Random Notes on random thoughts</h1>
    <aside>
        <p>This is the collection of my random notes and random thoughts. It contains code snippets or technical
            tidbits, collections of links on specific topics, and some quick ideas. Very often it
            contains my work-in-progress insights and is not very polished.</p>

                    playground without any backend and storage</h2>
                <p>I've been playing a lot with static websites recently and they are amazing! You can build useful
                    tools and handy helpers
                    and provide them at nearly no cost because they don't need a backend. Unfortunately, some tools
                    simply need a backend to store user-generated data. Or do they? That's why I experimented with an
                    <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language, the programming language that is used for authoring web sites">HTML</abbr>
                    playground that doesn't store anything and doesn't have a backend, but it still has shareable
                    <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator, the address that is used to access a resource on the internet, such as a website or image.">URLs</abbr>.
