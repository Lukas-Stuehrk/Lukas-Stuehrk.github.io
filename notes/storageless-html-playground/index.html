        <p>I know I also have a terrible record with open source maintenance, so I thought I’d archive the original
            and just post this instead. Do with it what you want!</p>
        <p>To be super clear, this is a reset that works for me, personally and us at Set Studio. Whenever I refer
            to
            “we”,
            that’s who I’m referring to.</p>
        <p>This rule is pretty self-explanatory, but in short, I’m setting all elements and pseudo-elements to use
            the
            border-box, rather than the default content-box for sizing. Now we’re focussing more on letting the
            <a href="#">browser</a>
            do
            more work with flexible layouts with fluid type and space, this rule isn’t as useful as it once was.
            But,
            it’s
            rare that a project doesn’t have some explicit sizing somewhere, so it’s still got a place in the
            reset.</p>
